            <br />

            information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain
            cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice .
            <br />
            <br />
            5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?
            <br />
            <br />
            In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may have
            access to certain information about you.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account
            details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain
            profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary
            depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
            list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media
            platform. If you log in using Facebook, we may also request access to other permissions related to your
            account, such as your friends, check-ins, and likes, and you may choose to grant or deny us access to each
            individual permission.
            <br />
            <br />
            We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or
            that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are
            not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We
            recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your
            personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
            <br />
            <br />
            6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
            <br />
            <br />
            In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
            privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.
            <br />
            <br />
            We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in
            this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
            accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal
            information for longer than three (3) months past the termination of the user&#39;s account .
            <br />
            <br />
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either
            delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
            information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and
            isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
            <br />
            <br />
            7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
            <br />
            <br />
            In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical
            security measures.
            <br />
            <br />
            We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to
            protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts
            to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology
            can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or
            other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access,
            steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
            transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access
            the Services within a secure environment.
            <br />

              may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your
              consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact
              details provided in the section &quot;

              However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal,
              nor when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
              reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

              <br />

            of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.

            <br />
            <br />
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
            (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
            about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology
            standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently
            respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to
            be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
            inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

            Verification process
            <br />
            <br />
            Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person
            about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to
            provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For
            instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so
            that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may
            contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us.
            We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
            <br />
            <br />
            We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to
            make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the
            purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already
            maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying
            your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided
            information as soon as we finish verifying you.
